## Description of Game
Loop Factory is a fast-paced 2D educational game that teaches players how to use for and while loops through interactive gameplay. Players take on the role of a junior robot engineer working in an automated factory where they collect, assemble, and ship items using loop logic. By managing conveyor belts and solving loop-based challenges, players gain hands-on experience with core programming concepts. Designed for beginners, classrooms, and anyone looking to refresh their coding skills, Loop Factory makes learning to code fun, visual, and engaging.
